Problem 1:
	in this problem, I provide the timberlake.info file which is the information for the systme in timberlake.
	And also I provide a script file for auto selected the system info  into different files.(I need to submit the timbelake, so I do not want to overwrite the timberlake.info)


Problem 5:
	I did not add the timer into the program before. Instead, I wrote a new .c
	file to call each program and calculat the time and print it out.
