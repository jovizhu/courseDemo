LCM1:
SOurce:LarryMoeCurly1.c jovi.h

I did not write the Larry, Moe and Curly in a forever loop.
But instead, I write it in a 100 times loop.
When they dig 100 holes, the process will stop by themselves.


LCM2:
SOurce: LarryMoeCurly2.c jovi.h

The same with before, I did not put the three guys in a forever loop.
They will stop by themselves when they dig 100 holes.

In my program, there are 9 elves, only 3 are allowed to rise problem at the same time.
And there are 9 reindeers and only one sanda.
And also I did not put them in a forever loop.
Instead, the reindeer will back twice , the elfves will rise problem 2 times.
So santa will be waked up 8 times.

This program is a forever loop and will not exit by themselves.
In this program, there are 100 customers will come in( one persone per second);
In my program, I did not set more semphore between Customer and Cahser. 
In the description of project 2, no synchronizaton constraints for a casher
presenting food to the customer.


PS:
The LCM1, LCM2 and SER and be modified to a forever loop by delelte the  "i++" in the main loop.
